In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (Alphabet)\\nbecame the successor issuer to Google.\\nWe generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising.\\nBasis of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\\nunder the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\\nThe Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2020, the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three\\nmonths ended March 31, 2019 and 2020, the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three\\nmonths ended March 31, 2019 and 2020, the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders\\' Equity for the three months\\nended March 31, 2019 and 2020 and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three months ended\\nMarch 31, 2019 and 2020 are unaudited. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been\\nprepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). In our opinion,\\nthe unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature\\nnecessary for the fair presentation of our financial position as of March 31, 2020, our results of operations for the\\nthree months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020, and our cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and\\n2020. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the\\nresults to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2020.\\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated\\nfinancial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\\nDecember 31, 2019 filed with the SEC.\\nUse of Estimates\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and\\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying\\nnotes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates,\\nincluding those related to the allowance for credit losses, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and\\ngoodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities,\\namong others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be\\nreasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and\\nliabilities.\\nAs of March 31, 2020, the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to unfold. As a result, many of our\\nestimates and assumptions required increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As\\nevents continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates may change materially in\\nfuture periods.\\nAccounts Receivable\\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or\\nservices offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or\\nservices and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable, which is recorded\\nas an offset to accounts receivable and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the\\nConsolidated Statements of Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis\\nwhere similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known\\ndisputes or collectibility issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical\\ncollectibility based on past due status and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on\\nongoing credit evaluations. We also consider customer-specific information, current market conditions and\\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data.\\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2020, our assessment considered business and market disruptions\\ncaused by COVID-19 and estimates of expected emerging credit and collectibility trends. The continued volatility in\\nmarket conditions and evolving shifts in credit trends are difficult to predict causing variability and volatility that may\\nhave a material impact on our allowance for credit losses in future periods. The allowance for credit losses on\\naccounts receivable was $275 million and $717 million as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020, respectively.\\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update No.\\n2016-13 (\"ASU 2016-13\") \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on\\nFinancial Instruments\", which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial\\nassets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected\\nloss model which requires the use of forward-looking information to calculate credit loss estimates. It also eliminates\\nthe concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to certain available-for-sale debt\\nsecurities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost\\nbasis of the securities. These changes result in earlier recognition of credit losses. We adopted ASU 2016-13 using\\nthe modified retrospective approach as of January 1, 2020. The cumulative effect upon adoption was not material to\\nour consolidated financial statements. See Note 3 for the effect on our consolidated financial statements for the\\nthree months ended March 31, 2020.\\nPrior Period Reclassifications\\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. Hedging\\ngains (losses), which were previously included in Google revenues, are now reported separately as a component of\\ntotal revenues for all periods presented. See Note 2 for further details.\\nNote 2.\\nRevenues\\nDisaggregated Revenues\\nThe following table presents our revenues disaggregated by revenue source (in millions, unaudited). Certain\\namounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\\nThree Months Ended\\nGoogle Search & other\\n$\\n$\\nGoogle properties\\nGoogle Network Members\\' properties\\nGoogle advertising\\nGoogle Cloud\\nGoogle revenues\\nOther Bets revenues\\nHedging gains (losses)\\nTotal revenues\\n$\\n$\\nYouTube non-advertising revenues are included in Google other revenues.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cThe following table presents our revenues disaggregated by geography, based on the addresses of our\\ncustomers (in millions, unaudited):\\n \\nThree Months Ended\\n \\nUnited States\\n$\\n45 % $\\nHedging gains (losses)\\nTotal revenues\\n$\\n100 % $\\nRegions represent Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (\"EMEA\"); Asia-Pacific (\"APAC\"); and Canada and Latin America\\n(\"Other Americas\").\\nDeferred Revenues\\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\\nincluding amounts which are refundable. The increase in the deferred revenue balance for the three months ended\\nMarch 31, 2020 was primarily driven by cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying our performance\\nobligations, offset by $1.0 billion of revenues recognized that were included in the deferred revenue balance as of\\nDecember 31, 2019.\\nAdditionally, we have performance obligations associated with commitments in customer contracts, primarily\\nrelated to Google Cloud, for future services that have not yet been recognized in revenue. This includes related\\ndeferred revenue currently recorded and amounts that will be invoiced in future periods. As of March 31, 2020, the\\namount not yet recognized in revenue from these commitments is $12.8 billion, which reflects our assessment of\\nrelevant contract terms and expectations of our customers’ intent and ability to utilize our services. This amount\\nexcludes contracts (i) with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize\\nrevenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We expect to recognize\\napproximately half over the next 24 months with the remaining thereafter. However, the amount and timing of\\nrevenue recognition is largely driven by customer utilization, which could impact our estimate of the remaining\\namount of commitments and when we expect to recognize such revenues.\\nNote 3.\\nFinancial Instruments\\nDebt Securities\\nWe classify and account for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale and carry these securities at\\nfair value.\\nWe report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders\\' equity, except for\\ncertain unrealized gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net, described below.\\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The estimate of\\ncredit loss is determined by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and\\ninformation about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance for\\ncredit loss is recorded as a charge to other income (expense), net, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss.\\nAny excess unrealized loss greater than the credit loss at a security level is recognized in accumulated other\\ncomprehensive income (\"AOCI\"). We assess expected credit losses at the end of each reporting period and adjust\\nthe allowance through other income (expense), net.\\nFor certain debt securities we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in\\nother income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains\\nand losses from related derivative contracts. Unrealized net loss related to debt securities still held where we have\\nelected the fair value option was $9 million for the period ended March 31, 2020.

All gains and losses on\\nmarketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net.\\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable\\nmarket values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value for observable\\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement\\nalternative). We qualitatively assess whether indicators of impairment exist. Factors considered in our assessment\\ninclude the companies’ financial and liquidity position, access to capital resources, exposure to industries and\\nmarkets impacted by COVID-19, and the time since the last adjustment to fair value, among others. If the\\nassessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we estimate the fair value by using the best information\\navailable, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data. The effect of COVID-19 on our\\nimpairment assessment requires significant judgment due to the uncertainty around the impact.\\nAll gains and losses, realized and unrealized, and impairments on non-marketable equity securities are\\nrecognized in other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the\\nperiod are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on\\nvaluation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and\\nother unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of non-\\nmarketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period due to impairment are classified within\\nLevel 3.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cGains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities\\nGains and losses reflected in other income (expense), net, for our marketable and non-marketable equity\\nsecurities are summarized below (in millions, unaudited):\\nThree Months Ended\\n \\nNet gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period\\n$\\n$\\nNet unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end of the period(1)\\nTotal gain (loss) recognized in other income (expense), net\\n$\\n$\\nIncludes net gain of $390 million and net loss of $948 million related to non-marketable equity securities for the three\\nmonths ended March 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\\nIn the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the\\nsale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if\\nlater. \\nCumulative net gains on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following table (in\\nmillions, unaudited), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity\\nsecurity.

Our share of gains and losses including\\nimpairment are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nSee Note 7 for further details on other income (expense), net.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nWe enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary\\nrisk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the\\nrisk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign\\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our business\\nexposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair\\nvalue and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts\\n(an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the\\npurchased and written options are with the same counterparty. For other derivative contracts, we present at gross\\nfair values. We primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other\\nincome (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below.\\nWe enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of\\ntransactions with the same counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for\\ncollateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from\\ncontractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral\\nsecurity arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0ccollateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other\\ncurrent assets.\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have\\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude the change in\\nforward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded\\ncomponent is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues.\\nThe difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is\\nrecorded in AOCI. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI\\nare immediately reclassified to other income (expense), net.\\nAs of March 31, 2020, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect\\nwas $304 million, of which $304 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12\\nmonths.\\nFair Value Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\\ninvestments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the\\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains\\nand losses of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in forward points from the assessment of hedge\\neffectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\\nNet Investment Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of\\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude\\nchanges in forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded\\ncomponent in other income (expense), net.\\nOther Derivatives\\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts\\nthat we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies\\nother than the local currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs, are\\nrecognized in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets\\nand

We are the primary\\nbeneficiary because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect their economic performance\\nand have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. The results of operations and financial\\nposition of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to\\nus. As of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs\\nwere $3.1 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs\\nwere $1.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.\\nTotal noncontrolling interests, including redeemable noncontrolling interest, in our consolidated subsidiaries\\nincreased from $1.2 billion to $2.8 billion from December 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020, primarily due to external\\ninvestments in Waymo.

In March 2020, Waymo announced its first externally led investment with an\\ninitial close of $2.2 billion, which included an investment from Alphabet. No gain or loss was recognized. The\\ninvestments related to external parties were accounted for as equity transactions and resulted in recognition of\\nnoncontrolling interests.\\nUnconsolidated VIEs\\nCertain of our non-marketable investments, including certain renewable energy investments accounted for\\nunder the equity method and certain other investments in private companies, are VIEs. The renewable energy\\nentities\\' activities involve power generation using renewable sources. Private companies that we invest in are\\nprimarily early stage companies.\\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we do not consolidate these VIEs in our\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to\\nthese VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated\\nVIEs were not material as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020.\\nNote 6.\\nDebt\\nShort-Term Debt\\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper.

An aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.7 billion\\nof the Google Notes was exchanged for approximately $1.7 billion of Alphabet notes with identical interest rate and\\nmaturity. Because the exchange was between a parent and the subsidiary company and for substantially identical\\nnotes, the change was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes with no gain or loss recognized.\\nIn August 2016, Alphabet issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes (\"2016 Notes\") due 2026. The net\\nproceeds from the issuance of the 2016 Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment\\nof outstanding commercial paper.

We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of\\nrepresentations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain\\nparties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the\\namount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors,\\nand our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have\\na limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not\\nhad a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent\\nthat valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\\nAs of March 31, 2020, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\\npossible.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cLegal Matters\\nAntitrust Investigations\\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC\\'s Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various\\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display\\nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a\\n€2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision and on\\nSeptember 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC\\'s\\ndecision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017.\\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution\\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30,\\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision.\\nOn October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. We recognized a\\ncharge of $5.1 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2018.\\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that\\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine\\nof €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners\\'\\nagreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We\\nrecognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.\\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities\\nin the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. For example, in August 2019, we began receiving civil\\ninvestigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting information and documents relating to our\\nprior antitrust investigations and certain of our business practices. Attorneys general from 51 U.S. states and\\nterritories have also opened antitrust investigations into certain of our business practices. We continue to cooperate\\nwith federal and state regulators in the United States, and other regulators around the world.\\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others\\' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\\nto change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (\"ITC\")\\nhas increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an\\nITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such\\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In\\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\nIn 2010, Oracle America, Inc. (\"Oracle\") brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of\\nCalifornia, alleging that Google\\'s Android operating system infringes Oracle\\'s copyrights related to certain Java\\napplication programming interfaces. After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on\\nJune 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March 27, 2018,\\nthe appeals court reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages. On May 29, 2018, we filed a petition for\\na rehearing at the Federal Circuit, and on August 28, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied the petition. On January 24,\\n2019, we filed a petition to the Supreme Court of the United States to review this case. On April 29, 2019, the\\nSupreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition. On September 27, 2019, the\\nSolicitor General recommended denying our petition, and we provided our response on October 16, 2019. On\\nNovember 15, 2019, the Supreme Court granted our petition and made a decision to review the case. If the\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cSupreme Court does not rule in our favor, the case will be remanded to the district court for further determination of\\nthe remaining issues in the case, including damages, if any. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and are\\ndefending ourselves vigorously. Given the nature of this case, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible\\nloss or range of loss, if any, arising from this matter.\\nOther\\nWe are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings\\ninvolving competition, intellectual property, privacy, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial\\ndisputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our\\nplatforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government\\ninvestigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse\\nconsequences.\\nCertain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We\\nrecord a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably\\nestimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we\\ndisclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount\\nof liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and\\nmake adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and\\nthe estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.\\nWith respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range\\nof reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our\\nbusiness, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such\\nmatters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\\nNon-Income Taxes\\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters.\\nThe subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied\\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We\\naccrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax\\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We believe these matters are\\nwithout merit and we are defending ourselves vigorously. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these\\nmatters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our\\nexpectations.\\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 14.\\nNote 11.\\nStockholders\\' Equity\\nShare Repurchases\\nIn July 2019, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $25.0 billion of its\\nClass C capital stock. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and\\nmarket conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated\\ntransactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2020, we repurchased and subsequently retired 6.5 million shares\\nof Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $8.5 billion.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cNote 12.\\nNet Income Per Share\\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A and Class B\\ncommon stock and Class C capital stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and\\nper share amounts, unaudited):\\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\n \\n \\nClass A\\nClass B\\nClass C\\nClass A\\nClass B\\nClass C\\nBasic net income per share:\\nNumerator\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings \\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\nDenominator\\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\\nBasic net income per share\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\nDiluted net income per share:\\nNumerator\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic \\ncomputation \\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of \\nconversion of Class B to Class A shares\\nReallocation of undistributed earnings\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\nDenominator\\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\\nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\\nAdd:\\nConversion of Class B to Class A common shares \\noutstanding\\nRestricted stock units and other contingently \\nissuable shares\\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\\nDiluted net income per share\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\nFor the periods presented above, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B\\ncommon stock and Class C capital stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share\\ndividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of\\nAlphabet Inc.\\nNote 13.\\nCompensation Plans\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020, total stock-based compensation (\"SBC\") expense was\\n$2.9 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet\\nstock of $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cStock-Based Award Activities\\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") in Alphabet stock \\nfor the three months ended March 31, 2020 (unaudited): \\n \\nUnvested Restricted Stock Units\\n \\nNumber of\\nShares\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nGrant-Date\\nFair Value\\nUnvested as of December 31, 2019\\n$\\nGranted\\n$\\n Vested\\n Forfeited/canceled\\nUnvested as of March 31, 2020\\n$\\nAs of March 31, 2020, there was $27.9 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested\\nemployee RSUs.

Our effective tax rate is based on forecasted annual\\nresults which may fluctuate significantly through the rest of the year, in particular due to the uncertainty in our\\nannual forecasts resulting from the unpredictable impact of COVID-19 on our operating results.\\nOur effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate\\nprimarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates and partially offset by the impact from the non-deductible EC\\nfine.\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\\nevaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Our total gross unrecognized\\ntax benefits were $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020. Our total unrecognized tax benefits\\nthat, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 and March 31,\\n2020. Although the timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is\\nreasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months.\\nFor information regarding non-income taxes, see Note 10.\\nNote 15.\\nInformation about Segments and Geographic Areas\\nWe operate our business in multiple operating segments.

TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") was 22.1%.\\n•\\nOperating expenses (excluding cost of revenues) were $14.2 billion.\\n•\\nIncome from operations was $8.0 billion.\\n•\\nOther income (expense), net, was a loss of $220 million.\\n•\\nEffective tax rate was 11.9%.\\n•\\nNet income was $6.8 billion with diluted net income per share of $9.87.\\n•\\nOperating cash flow was $11.5 billion.\\n•\\nCapital expenditures were $6.0 billion.\\n•\\nNumber of employees was 123,048 as of March 31, 2020. The majority of new hires during the quarter were\\nengineers and product managers. By product area, the largest headcount additions were in Google Cloud\\nand Search.\\nThe Impact of COVID-19 on our Results and Operations\\nIn late 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged and by March 11, 2020 was declared a global pandemic by\\nThe World Health Organization. Across the United States and the world, governments and municipalities instituted\\nmeasures in an effort to control the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school\\nclosings, travel restrictions and the closure of non-essential businesses. By the end of March, the macroeconomic\\nimpacts became significant, exhibited by, among other things, a rise in unemployment and market volatility.\\nFor most of the quarter ended March 31, 2020, our results reflect historical trends and seasonality. However, in\\nMarch 2020 we experienced a decline in advertising revenues due to the impact of COVID-19 and the related\\nreductions in global economic activity. While users’ search activity increased, their interests shifted to less\\ncommercial topics. In addition, our advertising revenues were negatively affected by reduced spending by our\\nadvertisers in response to the macroeconomic impact.\\nWe also assessed the realized and potential credit deterioration of our customers due to changes in the\\nmacroeconomic environment, which has been reflected in an increase in our allowance for credit losses for\\naccounts receivable. In addition, we experienced declines in the valuation of our equity investments.\\nLooking ahead, the full impact of COVID-19 on our business is unknown and highly unpredictable. Our past\\nresults may not be indicative of our future performance and historical trends in revenues, operating income,\\noperating margin, net income, EPS, among others, may differ materially. For example, to the extent the pandemic\\ncontinues to disrupt economic activity globally we, like other businesses, would not be immune as it could adversely\\naffect our business, operations and financial results through prolonged decreases in advertising spend, credit\\ndeterioration of our customers, depressed economic activity, or declines in capital markets. In addition, many of our\\nexpenses are less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenues. The extent of the impact will\\ndepend on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the pandemic; advances in testing, treatment\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cand prevention; and the macroeconomic impact of government measures to contain the spread of the virus and\\nrelated government stimulus measures.\\nTo address the potential impact to our business, over the near-term, we are reevaluating the pace of our\\ninvestment plans, including, but not limited to, our hiring, investments in data centers, servers, network equipment,\\nreal estate and facilities, and marketing and travel spending, as well as taking certain measures to support our\\ncustomers.\\nInformation about Segments\\nWe operate our business in multiple operating segments. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our\\nother segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating\\nsegments are combined and disclosed as Other Bets.\\nOur reported segments are:\\n•\\nGoogle – Google includes our main products such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Cloud,\\nGoogle Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube.

The overall growth for the period was primarily driven by interrelated\\nfactors including increases in search queries resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on\\nmobile devices, growth in advertiser activity, and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. However,\\nrevenue declined in March, driven by the impact of COVID-19. While we experienced an increase in user search\\nactivity in March, our revenues were adversely affected by a shift to less commercial topics and reduced advertiser\\nspending. Revenue growth for the period ending March 31, 2020 was also partially offset by the general\\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.\\nYouTube ads\\nYouTube ads revenues increased $1,013 million from the three months ended March 31, 2019 to the three\\nmonths ended March 31, 2020. The largest contributors to the growth were our direct response and brand\\nadvertising products, both of which benefited from improvements to ad formats and delivery and increased\\nadvertiser spending.

This growth\\nwas offset by a deceleration in paid clicks in March as a result of the impact of COVID-19, when search activity\\nshifted to less commercial topics.\\nThe overall positive effect on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in\\nthe cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in\\nYouTube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other advertising platforms, as well as a\\nmix shift to less commercial topics and reduced advertiser spending in response to COVID-19 in March.

Our international revenues are favorably affected as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign\\ncurrencies, and unfavorably affected as the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. Our\\nrevenues are also favorably affected by net hedging gains and unfavorably affected by net hedging losses.\\nWe use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth for financial and\\noperational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation\\nof results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our\\nperformance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core\\noperating results.\\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign\\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on\\na year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior\\nperiod exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\\nConstant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in\\ncurrent period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated\\nusing prior period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.\\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled\\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cThe following table presents the foreign exchange effect on our international revenues and total revenues (in\\nmillions, except percentages, unaudited):\\n \\nThree Months Ended\\n \\nEMEA revenues\\n$\\n$\\nExclude foreign exchange effect on current period revenues using prior \\nyear rates\\nEMEA constant currency revenues\\n$\\n$\\nPrior period EMEA revenues\\n$\\n$\\nEMEA revenue growth\\nEMEA constant currency revenue growth\\nAPAC revenues\\n$\\n$\\nExclude foreign exchange effect on current period revenues using prior \\nyear rates\\nAPAC constant currency revenues\\n$\\n$\\nPrior period APAC revenues\\n$\\n$\\nAPAC revenue growth\\nAPAC constant currency revenue growth\\nOther Americas revenues\\n$\\n$\\nExclude foreign exchange effect on current period revenues using prior \\nyear rates\\nOther Americas constant currency revenues\\n$\\n$\\nPrior period Other Americas revenues\\n$\\n$\\nOther Americas revenue growth\\nOther Americas constant currency revenue growth\\nUnited States revenues\\n$\\n$\\nUnited States revenue growth\\nHedging gains\\n$\\n$\\nTotal revenues\\n$\\n$\\nTotal constant currency revenues\\n$\\n$\\nPrior period revenues, excluding hedging effect(1)\\n$\\n$\\nTotal revenue growth\\nTotal constant currency revenue growth\\nTotal revenues and hedging (losses) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $31,146 million and $(239) million,\\nrespectively.\\nOur EMEA revenue growth from the three months ended March 31, 2019 to the three months ended March 31,\\n2020 was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar\\nstrengthening relative to the Euro.\\nOur APAC revenue growth from the three months ended March 31, 2019 to the three months ended March 31,\\n2020 was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily due to the U.S. dollar\\nstrengthening relative to the Australian dollar and South Korean won.\\nOur Other Americas revenue growth from the three months ended March 31, 2019 to the three months ended\\nMarch 31, 2020 was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S.\\ndollar strengthening relative to the Brazilian real.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cCosts and Expenses\\nCost of Revenues\\nCost of revenues consists of TAC which are paid to Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed on\\ntheir properties and amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and\\nservices.

As events continue\\nto evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates may change materially in future periods.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\\nevaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Our interim tax accruals are\\nbased on an estimated annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income along with certain discrete items\\nrecorded in the period. Estimates of the annual effective tax rate at the end of an interim period are based on our\\nbest estimate of future events and transactions which, as a result of COVID-19, may be impacted by a higher\\ndegree of variability and volatility. As such, evolving facts and circumstances surrounding these forecasts could\\nresult in the application of different provisions of tax laws and cause our estimated annual effective tax rate to\\nchange significantly through the remainder of the year.\\nAlthough we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given\\nthat the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts\\nand circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final\\ntax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for\\nincome taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are\\nconsidered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the\\ncontinuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and other tax authorities\\nwhich may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from\\nthese examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\\nAvailable Information\\nOur website is located at www.abc.xyz, and our investor relations website is located at www.abc.xyz/investor.\\nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and our Proxy\\nStatements, and any amendments to these reports, are available through our investor relations website, free of\\ncharge, after we file them with the SEC.

Due to recent financial market movements and changes to our expectations of near-\\nterm possible movements caused by the impact of COVID-19, we are providing an update to the disclosures made\\nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 regarding quantitative and qualitative\\ndisclosures about market risk as of March 31, 2020.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and\\nexpenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange\\nrates against the U.S. dollar. Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian\\ndollar, Euro and Japanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the\\nhistorical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse\\nchanges in exchange rates of 10% could be experienced in the near term.\\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities\\ndenominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce, but do\\nnot entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The\\nforeign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which\\nare offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts.\\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets and liabilities\\ndenominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates, it would have resulted in an\\nadverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $19 million as of March 31, 2020. The adverse\\neffect as of March 31, 2020 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately $474 million from foreign\\nexchange contracts in place for the three months ended March 31, 2020.\\nWe use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a\\ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from\\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency options\\nand forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from\\nforeign currency collars and forwards offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging\\ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We\\ndesignate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign\\ncurrency spot rate changes as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the\\nhedged exposures as they occur.\\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of March 31, 2020, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign\\nexchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $959 million lower as of March 31, 2020. The\\nchange in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in\\nforecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign\\ncurrency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign\\ncurrency translation risk from our foreign operations.\\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (\"CTA\") within\\nAOCI related to our net investment hedge would have been approximately $928 million lower as of March 31, 2020.\\nThe change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain\\nor loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and\\nmaintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities including those of the U.S. government and its agencies,\\ncorporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time\\ndeposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued by foreign governments. By policy, we limit the\\namount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning\\nsecurities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely\\naffected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if\\ninterest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate\\nfluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. We account for both fixed and variable rate\\nsecurities at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit\\nlosses.\\nWe use value-at-risk (\"VaR\") analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the\\nvalue of our marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence\\ninterval, for our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR\\nmodel with 95% confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of our marketable debt securities as of\\nMarch 31, 2020 are shown below (in millions):\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cAs of March 31, 2020\\nas of March 31, 2020\\nRisk Category - Interest Rate\\n$\\n$\\nActual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from\\nthe sensitivity analyses performed as of March 31, 2020 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting\\nthe timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not\\nintended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\\nEquity Investment Risk\\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that\\ncould substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities\\nare investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\\nWe record our marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on\\nreadily determinable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price\\nvolatility, and represent $2.8 billion of our investments as of March 31, 2020. A hypothetical adverse price change of\\n30%, which could be experienced in the near term, would decrease the fair value of our marketable equity securities\\nby $844 million.\\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for\\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the\\nmeasurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an\\nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the\\nearly stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development\\nare typically in the early phases and may never materialize and they may experience a decline in financial condition,\\nwhich could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The success of our\\ninvestment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation\\nin the value of our investments through liquidity events such as public offerings, acquisitions, private sales or other\\nmarket events. As of March 31, 2020, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were\\naccounted for under the measurement alternative, was $10.8 billion. Valuations of our equity investments in private\\ncompanies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. Volatility in the global\\neconomic climate and financial markets could result in a significant impairment charge relating to our non-\\nmarketable equity securities. Changes in valuation of non-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate\\nwith changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. Additionally, observable transactions at lower valuations\\ncould result in significant losses on our non-marketable equity securities. The effect of COVID-19 on our impairment\\nassessment requires significant judgment due to the uncertainty around the impact.\\nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.2 billion as of March 31,\\n2020, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes, however these investments could be impaired if\\nthe carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\\nFor further information about our equity investments, please refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nITEM 4.\\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the\\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the\\nend of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nBased on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of March 31,\\n2020, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to\\nprovide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the\\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s\\nrules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our\\nchief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\\ndisclosure.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended\\nMarch 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting.\\nAs a result of COVID-19, our global workforce shifted to a primarily work from home environment beginning in\\nMarch 2020. This change to remote working was rapid and included both our employees as well as a large\\nextended workforce across all regions in which we operate. While pre-existing controls were not specifically\\ndesigned to operate in our current work from home operating environment, we believe that our internal controls over\\nfinancial reporting continue to be effective. We took precautionary actions to re-evaluate and refine our financial\\nreporting process to provide reasonable assurance that we could report our financial results accurately and timely.\\nWe rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating\\nresults. In 2019, we began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”)\\nsystem, which will replace much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately\\nmaintain our financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management and provide\\ntimely information to our management team. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next\\nseveral years, with initial changes to our general ledger and consolidated financial reporting to take place in 2020.\\nAs the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we will change our processes and procedures\\nwhich, in turn, could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will\\nevaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls\\nand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving\\nthe desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that\\nthere are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of\\npossible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cPART II.\\nOTHER INFORMATION\\nITEM 1.\\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\nFor a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 10 “Contingencies - Legal Matters” of the\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which\\nis incorporated herein by reference.\\nITEM 1A.\\nRISK FACTORS\\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to\\nthose described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nRisks Specific to our Company\\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising, and reduced spending by\\nadvertisers, a loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our\\nability to customize ads could harm our business.\\nWe generated over 83% of total revenues from the display of ads online in 2019 and 82% in the three months\\nended March 31, 2020. Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital\\npublishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time. These partners may not\\ncontinue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers,\\nnew sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives.\\nChanges to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, as well as changes to other companies’ advertising\\npolicies or practices may affect the advertising that we are able to provide, which could harm our business. In\\naddition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads\\naltogether and some providers of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the\\navailability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver\\nadvertisements effectively and competitively could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and\\nbudgeting and buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including COVID-19 and its effects on the\\nglobal economy (as discussed in greater detail in our COVID-19 risk factor under ‘General Risks’ below), can also\\nhave a material negative effect on the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they\\nspend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that\\nare useful to users, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our business and operating results.\\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing\\ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete\\nsuccessfully, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful\\nproducts, services, and technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to\\ninnovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in\\nresearch and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and existing\\nproducts and services.\\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international\\ncompetitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer\\noperating histories in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our\\ncompetitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in research and development and\\nin talent, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete\\naggressively for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Our competitors may be able to innovate and\\nprovide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us. For\\nexample, we are investing significantly in subscription-based products and services such as YouTube, which face\\nintense competition from large experienced companies with well established relationships with users.\\nOur operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the needs of our users,\\nadvertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As technologies continue to develop, our competitors\\nmay be able to offer experiences that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This\\nmay force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. If our\\ncompetitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users,\\nadvertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers, our operating results could be harmed.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky,\\nand could disrupt our current operations and harm our financial condition and operating results.\\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies.\\nThe investments that we are making across Google and Other Bets reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and\\nprovide products and services that are useful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers.\\nOur investments in Google and Other Bets span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. Such\\ninvestments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in\\npursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. These endeavors may involve significant risks and\\nuncertainties, including diversion of management resources and, with respect to Other Bets, the use of alternative\\ninvestment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the\\ncompany or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\\nWithin Google, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones and home devices, which\\nis a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of\\ntechnological advancements by competitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual\\nimprovement in product price and performance characteristics, and price and feature sensitivity on the part of\\nconsumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes\\neffectively.\\nWe are also devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services,\\nincluding Google Cloud Platform and G Suite. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support\\ncloud computing services and hire talent, particularly to support and scale the Cloud salesforce. At the same time,\\nour competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are\\ncompetitive and evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives.\\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among\\nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large experienced and well-funded competitors and\\nour offerings may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use artificial intelligence and machine\\nlearning, raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands\\nand demand for our products and services. Because all of these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance\\ncan be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not harm our reputation, financial\\ncondition, and operating results.\\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our\\noperating margin in the future.\\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing\\ncompetition and the continued expansion of our business into a variety of new fields. Changes in device mix,\\ngeographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, and property mix and an increasing competition\\nfor advertising may also affect our advertising revenue growth rate. We may also experience a decline in our\\nrevenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, if there is a decrease in the rate of adoption of our\\nproducts, services, and technologies, or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices used to access our\\nservices, among other factors. In addition, we expect that COVID-19 and its effects on the global economy will\\nimpact our revenue growth rate (as discussed in greater detail in our COVID-19 risk factor under ‘General Risks’\\nbelow).\\nIn addition to a decline in our revenue growth rate, we may also experience downward pressure on our\\noperating margin resulting from a variety of factors, such as the continued expansion of our business into new\\nfields, including products and services such as hardware, Google Cloud, Google Play, gaming, and subscription\\nproducts, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those we\\ngenerate from advertising. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing\\ncompetition and increased costs for many aspects of our business, including within advertising where changes such\\nas device mix, property mix, and partner agreements can affect margin. The margin we earn on revenues generated\\nfrom our Google Network Members could also decrease in the future if we pay a larger percentage of advertising\\nfees to them. We may also pay increased TAC to our distribution partners as well as increased content acquisition\\ncosts to content providers. We may also face an increase in infrastructure costs, supporting businesses such as\\nSearch, Google Cloud, and YouTube. Many of our expenses are less variable in nature and may not correlate to\\nchanges in revenues.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cDue to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical\\noperating margin may not be indicative of our future performance.\\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of\\nour products, services and brand as well as affect our ability to compete.\\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets\\nfor us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our\\nproducts, services, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in\\nevery country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the\\nefforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain\\npatent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations.\\nMoreover, we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be\\nimportant. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained\\nwill be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and\\nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting\\nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the\\nword “Google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts\\nhave ruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of\\nthe United States, may reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark,\\nwhich could result in other people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our\\nbrand.\\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to\\ncompete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the\\nunauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating\\nresults.\\nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt\\nour ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\\nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing\\nthe brands within Google and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and\\ninnovative products that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other\\npartners. Our brands may be negatively affected by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational\\nissues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and security issues and developments, and product\\nor technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to appropriately respond to the sharing of misinformation or\\nobjectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers, or to otherwise adequately address\\nuser concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by the use\\nof our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be false or misleading.\\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance equity in our brands may harm our business, financial condition,\\nand operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to\\nprovide high-quality, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of\\nsettings.\\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could harm\\nour financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our\\nability to supply both our products and our internet-based services.\\nWe rely on other companies to manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products, to design certain of\\nour components and parts, and to participate in the distribution of our products and services. Our business could be\\nnegatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on\\nreasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other\\nreasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.\\nWe may experience supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material availability, manufacturing\\ncapacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, natural disasters or pandemics\\n(including COVID-19), the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and\\nincreased storm severity), and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. We may\\nexperience shortages or other supply chain disruptions that could negatively affect our operations. In addition, some\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cof the components we use in our technical infrastructure and products are available only from a single source or\\nlimited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply\\nchain disruption. In addition, a significant supply interruption could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions\\nand delay product availability.\\nWe may enter into long term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and\\nconditions. We may be liable for materials and products that are not consumed due to market acceptance,\\ntechnological change, obsolescences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of\\nour hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our\\nhardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and\\nmanufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture\\nand negatively affect our financial results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable\\ncontractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and\\nmay affect our supply.\\nOur products and services may have quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or operations.\\nSometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the\\nquality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are defective, it could\\nharm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company\\npolicies, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data\\nsecurity, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices.\\nViolations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to\\nkey relationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual\\nproperty, could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.\\nInterruption, interference with, or failure of our information technology and communications systems\\ncould hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation,\\nfinancial condition, and operating results. In addition, complications with the design or implementation of\\nour new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system could harm our business and operations.\\nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing\\noperation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage,\\ninterference, or interruption from terrorist attacks, natural disasters or pandemics (including COVID-19), the effects\\nof climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased storm severity), power loss,\\ntelecommunications failures, computer viruses, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing\\nschemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a\\nhigh risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage,\\nand intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced\\nby facility operators. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account\\nfor all eventualities.\\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19), closure of a facility, or other\\nunanticipated problems at, or impacting, our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In\\naddition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities,\\nwhich could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems.\\nIn addition, we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and\\nsummarize operating results. We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system, which will\\nreplace much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our\\nfinancial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management, and provide timely\\ninformation to our management team. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP system without\\nexperiencing delays, increased costs, and other difficulties. Failure to successfully design and implement the new\\nERP system as planned could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Additionally, if we do\\nnot effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the\\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be negatively affected.\\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, our financial\\ncondition, and operating results.\\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow\\ninternationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 54% of our consolidated revenues in the three\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cmonths ended March 31, 2020. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations\\nexpose us to other risks, including the following:\\n•\\nRestrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might\\nprevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.\\n•\\nImport and export requirements, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, and customs classifications that may\\nprevent us from offering products or providing services to a particular market, or that could limit our ability to\\nsource assemblies and finished products from a particular market, and may increase our operating costs.\\n•\\nLonger payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud.\\n•\\nEvolving foreign events, including Brexit, the United Kingdom\\'s withdrawal from the European Union (EU).\\nBrexit may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new regulatory costs and challenges\\n(including the transfer of personal data between the EU and the United Kingdom), in addition to other\\nadverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate.\\n•\\nAnti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain\\npayments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties.\\n•\\nUncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and\\nlack of legal precedent.\\n•\\nDifferent employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and labor unions, and other\\nchallenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in\\ncertain jurisdictions.\\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S.\\ndollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our\\ninternational currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign\\ncurrencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could\\nexpose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results.\\nRisks Related to our Industry\\nPeople access the Internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the\\nadvancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions\\nof our products and services developed for these new interfaces, our business could be harmed.\\nPeople access the Internet through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, mobile phones,\\nsmartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables, automobiles, and\\ntelevision-streaming devices. Our products and services may be less popular on these new interfaces. Each\\nmanufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services\\nmay not be available on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products\\non their devices. In addition, search queries are increasingly being undertaken via voice-activated speakers, apps,\\nsocial media or other platforms, which could harm our business. It is hard to predict the challenges we may\\nencounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect\\nto continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple\\nplatforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, suppliers,\\ndistributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices\\nand platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future\\nbusiness opportunities.\\nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could damage our\\nreputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from\\nusing our products and services. Software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks on our systems\\ncould result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users and customers’\\nability to use our products and services, harming our business operations and reputation.\\nConcerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information\\nor other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our reputation, financial condition, and\\noperating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as expectations regarding privacy and data\\nchange.\\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, and bugs, theft,\\nmisuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cthis information, improper use and disclosure of such information, litigation, and other potential liability. Systems and\\ncontrol failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure of user\\ndata could result in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our\\nbusiness, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. We expect to continue to expend significant\\nresources to maintain security protections that shield against bugs, theft, misuse, or security vulnerabilities or\\nbreaches.\\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular\\nbasis. We may experience future security issues, whether due to employee error or malfeasance or system errors\\nor vulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure.\\nGovernment inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and adverse press coverage could harm our business.\\nWe may be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures.\\nAttacks and security issues could also compromise trade secrets and other sensitive information, harming our\\nbusiness.\\nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including\\ndedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster\\nor pandemic (including COVID-19), may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident,\\nmay not respond quickly enough, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer\\nsignificant legal, reputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and\\noperating results.\\nOur ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of\\nour platforms and misuse of user data.\\nIn addition to our efforts to mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety, security, and\\ncontent review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties,\\nincluding investigations and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our\\nservices. As a result of these efforts, we could discover incidents of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data\\nor other undesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result\\nof our data limitations, including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our\\nplatform, or other factors, including factors outside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic (including\\nCOVID-19), and we may be notified of such incidents or activity via third parties. Such incidents and activities may\\ninclude the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the\\nexistence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper ad purchases, activities that\\nthreaten people’s safety on- or offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading disinformation. We may\\nalso be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents. Any of the\\nforegoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and brands, require\\nus to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adversely affect our business and\\nfinancial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which\\ncould result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s time and attention, and lead to enhanced\\nregulatory oversight.\\nProblematic content, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content farms, and\\nother violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could damage our\\nreputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.\\nWe, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines, including sophisticated attempts by\\nbad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues, or to otherwise\\ngenerate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest significantly in efforts to\\npromote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and invalid traffic, we may\\nbe unable to adequately detect and prevent such abuses or promote high-quality content, particularly during times\\nof a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19).\\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher\\nin search results than our search engine\\'s assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts\\n(known as “web spam”) may affect the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading\\nor undesirable content.\\nAlthough English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam in most other\\nlanguages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings.\\nWe continuously combat web spam in our search results, including through indexing technology that makes it\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0charder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We also continue to invest in and deploy proprietary\\ntechnology to detect and prevent web spam from abusing our platforms.\\nWe also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which\\nare websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their search rankings. We\\nare continually launching algorithmic changes focused on low-quality websites.\\nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality\\ncontent, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our\\nfinancial condition or operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result\\nin monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory\\noversight.\\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users.\\nInternet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our\\nproducts and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products\\nrequire significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have\\nsignificant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone\\ncompanies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some\\nof these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase\\nthe cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support\\nor facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings. Some\\njurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access providers;\\nhowever, substantial uncertainty exists in the United States and elsewhere regarding such protections. For example,\\nin 2018 the United States Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could lead\\ninternet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In\\naddition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or\\nblockages. COVID-19 has also resulted in quarantines, shelter in place orders, and work from home directives, all of\\nwhich have increased demands for internet access and may create access challenges. These could result in a loss\\nof existing users, customers and advertisers, goodwill, and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract\\nnew users, customers and advertisers, thereby harming our business.\\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\\nWe are subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as well as changes in public policies governing a wide\\nrange of topics that may negatively affect our business.\\nWe and other companies in the technology industry are experiencing increased regulatory scrutiny. For\\ninstance, various regulatory agencies, including competition, consumer protection, and privacy authorities, are\\nreviewing aspects of our products and services. We continue to cooperate with these investigations. Prior, existing,\\nand new investigations have in the past and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, changes to\\nour products and services, alterations to our business operations, and civil litigation, all of which could harm our\\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nChanges in international and local social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and\\npolicies governing a wide range of topics may increase our cost of doing business, limit our ability to pursue certain\\nbusiness models or offer certain products or services, and cause us to change our business practices. Further, our\\ninvestment in a variety of new fields, including the health industry and payment services, also raises a number of\\nnew regulatory issues. These factors could harm our business and operating results in material ways.\\nA variety of new and existing laws and/or interpretations could harm our business.\\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters.\\nNew laws and regulations (or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner\\ninconsistent with our practices) may make our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain\\nbusiness models or offer certain products and services, require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to\\nunanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These laws and regulations are\\nevolving and involve matters central to our business, including, among others:\\n•\\nCompetition laws and regulations around the world.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0c•\\nPrivacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 that came into effect in January of 2020,\\nwhich gives new data privacy rights to California residents, and SB-327 in California, which regulates the\\nsecurity of data in connection with internet connected devices.\\n•\\nData protection laws passed by many states within the U.S. and by certain countries regarding notification\\nto data subjects and/or regulators when there is a security breach of personal data.\\n•\\nCopyright laws, such as the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (EUCD) of April 17,\\n2019, which increases the liability of content-sharing services with respect to content uploaded by their\\nusers. It has also created a new property right in news publications that limits the ability of some online\\nservices to interact with or present such content. Each EU Member State must implement the EUCD by\\nJune 7, 2021. In addition, there are new constraining licensing regimes that limit our ability to operate with\\nrespect to copyright protected works.\\n•\\nData localization laws, which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country\\nbe stored and/or processed within that country.\\n•\\nVarious U.S. and international laws that govern the distribution of certain materials to children and regulate\\nthe ability of online services to collect information from minors.\\n•\\nVarious laws with regard to content removal and disclosure obligations, such as the Network Enforcement\\nAct in Germany, which may affect our businesses and operations and may subject us to significant fines if\\nsuch laws are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices or when we may not\\nproactively discover such content due to the scale of third-party content and the limitations of existing\\ntechnologies. Other countries, including Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom, have implemented\\nor are considering similar legislation imposing penalties for failure to remove certain types of content.\\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these laws, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain and could\\nharm our business. For example:\\n•\\nWe rely on statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the United States\\nand the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, against copyright liability for various linking, caching, and hosting\\nactivities. Any legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us.\\n•\\nCourt decisions such as the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on May 13,\\n2014 on the ‘right to be forgotten,’ which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results\\nabout them in certain instances, may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant\\noperational burdens.\\n•\\nCourt decisions that require Google to remove links not just in the jurisdiction of the issuing court, but for all\\nversions of the search engine worldwide, including in locations where the content at issue is lawful, may\\nlimit the content we can show to our users and impose significant operational burdens. The Supreme Court\\nof Canada issued such a decision against Google in June 2017, and others could treat its decision as\\npersuasive. With respect to the ‘right to be forgotten,’ a follow-up case of the CJEU on September 24, 2019\\nruled that a search engine operator is not required to remove links from all versions of the search engine\\nworldwide, but the court also noted in some cases, removal of links from all versions of the search engine\\navailable from the EU (including non-EU specific versions) may be required.\\nThe introduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies, our activities in certain jurisdictions,\\nor other actions we take may subject us to additional laws and regulations. The costs of compliance with these laws\\nand regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with laws and\\nregulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to\\nsignificant liabilities and other penalties.\\nWe are subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may harm our\\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe are subject to claims, suits, and government investigations involving competition, intellectual property, data\\nprivacy and security, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by\\nour users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Due to\\nour manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of products, including hardware as well as Google Cloud offerings,\\nwe may also be subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection\\nclaims related to product defects, among other litigation. We may also be subject to claims involving health and\\nsafety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental impacts, or service disruptions or failures.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cAny of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, diversion of\\nmanagement resources, negative publicity and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a\\ncomplex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. The resolution of one or more such proceedings\\nhas resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other\\nsanctions that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content.\\nOur products and services let users exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct business,\\nand engage in various online activities. We also place advertisements displayed on other companies’ websites, and\\nwe offer third-party products, services, and/or content. The law relating to the liability of online service providers for\\nothers’ activities on their services is still somewhat unsettled both within the U.S. and internationally. Claims have\\nbeen brought against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and trademark infringement,\\nunfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of\\ninformation available on or via our services.\\nWe may be subject to claims by virtue of our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or\\nproviding access to content created by third parties. Defense of any such actions could be costly and involve\\nsignificant time and attention of our management and other resources, may result in monetary liabilities or penalties,\\nand may require us to change our business in an adverse manner.\\nPrivacy\\nand\\ndata\\nprotection\\nregulations\\nare\\ncomplex\\nand\\nrapidly\\nevolving\\nareas.\\nAdverse\\ninterpretations of these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\\nresults.\\nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory\\nproposals concerning data protection and limits on encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or\\nregulation could result in fines and orders requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse\\neffect on our ability to provide services, harming our business operations. Complying with these evolving laws could\\nresult in substantial costs and harm the quality of our products and services, negatively affecting our business, and\\nmay be particularly challenging during certain times, such as a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19).\\nRecent legal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding transfers of personal\\ndata from Europe to the United States. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all\\nof our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services that we offer to EU\\nusers or customers, or the monitoring of their behavior in the EU. The GDPR creates a range of new compliance\\nobligations.\\nEnsuring compliance with the GDPR is an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs, and despite our\\nefforts, governmental authorities or others have asserted and may continue to assert that our business practices fail\\nto comply with its requirements. If our operations are found to violate GDPR requirements, we may incur substantial\\nfines, have to change our business practices, and face reputational harm, any of which could have a material\\nadverse effect on our business. In particular, serious breaches of the GDPR can result in administrative fines of up\\nto 4% of annual worldwide revenues. Fines of up to 2% of annual worldwide revenues can be levied for other\\nspecified violations.\\nThe EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks allow U.S. companies that self-certify to the U.S.\\nDepartment of Commerce and publicly commit to comply with specified requirements to import personal data from\\nthe EU and Switzerland. However, these frameworks face a number of legal challenges and their validity remains\\nsubject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S. The potential invalidation of data\\ntransfer mechanisms could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data\\noutside of the EEA.\\nThese developments create some uncertainty, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or\\nharm the operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business.\\nWe face, and may continue to face intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to\\ndefend, result in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our\\nability to use certain technologies in the future.\\nWe, like other internet, technology and media companies, hold large numbers of patents, copyrights,\\ntrademarks, and trade secrets and are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other\\nviolations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent-holding companies may frequently seek to generate\\nincome from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us. As we have grown, the number of intellectual\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cproperty claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products, services, and\\ntechnologies.\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Other parties\\nhave also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S.\\nInternational Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell\\nour products or services in the U.S. or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers\\nare found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims. Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may\\ninclude awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or\\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. They may also cause us to\\nchange our business practices and require development of non-infringing products, services, or technologies, which\\ncould result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.\\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend\\nagainst certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual\\nproperty infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or\\nsignificant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also\\ndiscontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could\\nresult in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to\\nus by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers\\narising from intellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have\\nagreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those\\nassociated with intellectual property claims.\\nRegardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or\\nsettle. To the extent such claims are successful, they may harm our business, including our product and service\\nofferings, financial condition, or operating results.\\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that any share\\nrepurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the\\nvolatility of the price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserves.\\nIn January 2018, January 2019, and July 2019, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to\\nrepurchase up to $8.6 billion, $12.5 billion, and $25.0 billion of its Class C capital stock, respectively. Share\\nrepurchases pursuant to the January 2018 and January 2019 authorizations were completed in 2019. As of March\\n31, 2020, $12.3 billion remains available for repurchase. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date\\nand does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of\\nshares. Our share repurchase program could affect the price of our stock and increase volatility and may be\\nsuspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock.\\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate\\nmatters.\\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A common stock has one vote per share, and\\nour Class C capital stock has no voting rights. As of March 31, 2020, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned\\napproximately 84.3% of our outstanding Class B common stock, which represented approximately 51.2% of the\\nvoting power of our outstanding common stock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant\\ninfluence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate\\ntransactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition,\\nbecause our Class C capital stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of\\nthe Class C capital stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity\\nincentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of\\nour directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. This\\nconcentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and we may\\ntake actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the market price of our\\nClass A common stock and our Class C capital stock.\\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that\\nstockholders may consider favorable.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cProvisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a\\nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\\n•\\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for a tri-class capital stock structure. As a result of this structure,\\nLarry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the\\nelection of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company\\nor our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger,\\ntakeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial. As noted\\nabove, the issuance of the Class C capital stock could have the effect of continuing the influence of Larry\\nand Sergey.\\n•\\nOur board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board\\nof directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able\\nto fill vacancies on our board of directors.\\n•\\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of\\nour capital stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders\\' meeting.\\n•\\nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of\\nminority stockholders to elect director candidates.\\n•\\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to\\npropose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or\\ndeter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\\'s own slate of\\ndirectors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\\n•\\nOur board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock.\\nThe ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue\\npreferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to\\nacquire us.\\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware\\nlaw, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding\\nvoting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has\\napproved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\\nGeneral Risks\\nThe continuing impacts of COVID-19 are highly unpredictable and could be significant, and may have\\nan adverse effect on our business, operations and our future financial performance.\\nIn late 2019, COVID-19 emerged and by March 11, 2020 was declared a global pandemic by The World Health\\nOrganization. Governments and municipalities around the world instituted measures in an effort to control the\\nspread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school closings, travel restrictions, and closure\\nof non-essential businesses. By the end of March, the macroeconomic impacts became significant, exhibited by,\\namong other things, a rise in unemployment and market volatility.\\nThe global health and economic implications of this pandemic could have significant impacts on our business,\\noperations and future financial performance. As a result of the scale of the pandemic and the speed at which the\\nglobal community has been impacted, our quarterly and annual revenue growth rates and expenses as a\\npercentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical rates, and our future operating results may fall\\nbelow expectations.\\nThe impact of the pandemic on our business, operations and future financial performance could include, but\\nare not limited to:\\n•\\nSignificant decline in advertising revenues as advertiser spending slows due to an economic downturn. This\\ndecline in advertising revenues could persist through and beyond a recessionary period. In addition, we\\nmay experience a significant and prolonged shift in user behavior such as a shift in interests to less\\ncommercial topics.\\n•\\nSignificant decline in other revenues due to a decline in customer demand. For example, if consumer\\ndemand for electronics continues to decline, our hardware revenues could be significantly impacted.\\n•\\nAdverse impacts to our operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS and respective growth rates -\\nparticularly if expenses do not decrease across Alphabet at the same pace as revenue declines. Many of\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cour expenses are less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenues, such as\\ndepreciation and other costs associated with our technical infrastructure and office facilities, customer\\nsupport, content review and infrastructure maintenance costs. As such, we may not be able to decrease\\nthem significantly in the short-term, or we may choose not to significantly reduce them in an effort to remain\\nfocused on long-term outlook and investment opportunities.\\n•\\nSignificant decrease in our operating cash flows as a result of decreased advertiser spending and\\ndeterioration in the credit quality of our customers, which could adversely affect our accounts receivables.\\nInvesting cash flows could decrease due to slowing spend on data center and facilities construction projects\\ndue to a slowing or stopping of construction or significant restrictions placed on construction.\\n•\\nSignificant supply chain constraints such that we cannot procure the servers and other technology\\ninfrastructure needed to deliver our services to our users and customers. Supply chain constraints could\\nalso affect our ability to procure the components needed to manufacture our hardware products, thereby\\naffecting supply availability and timing of hardware launches. Increased pricing of these components could\\nalso affect infrastructure costs to deliver our services or costs of hardware products that we sell.\\n•\\nIncreased demand globally for bandwidth to support users who are at work and school remotely could result\\nin reduction of quality or curtailment of services, such as bandwidth capping on YouTube.\\n•\\nThe rapid and broad-based shift to a remote working environment creates inherent productivity, connectivity,\\nand oversight challenges. For example, governmental lockdowns, restrictions or new regulations could\\nsignificantly impact the ability of our employees and vendors to work productively. Governmental restrictions\\nhave been globally inconsistent and it is not clear when a return to worksite locations or travel will be\\npermitted or what restrictions will be in place in those environments. The extent and/or duration of ongoing\\nworkforce restrictions and limitations could impact our ability to enhance, develop and support existing\\nproducts and services, detect and prevent spam and problematic content, hold product sales and marketing\\nevents, and generate new sales leads, among others. In addition, the changed environment under which we\\nare operating could have an impact on our internal controls over financial reporting as well as our ability to\\nmeet a number of our compliance requirements in a timely or quality manner.\\n•\\nOngoing significant foreign exchange volatility could materially impact our revenues that are denominated in\\nforeign currencies, our ability or strategy to hedge our foreign exchange exposure. Additionally, volatility in\\ndebt and equity markets could affect the values of our debt and equity holdings and the realized gains or\\nlosses on the disposition of those holdings.\\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our\\nresults to fall short of expectations.\\nOur operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control.\\nAs a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you\\nshould not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our quarterly, year-to-date, and\\nannual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical rates. Our operating\\nresults in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each\\nof the risk factors listed in this section in addition to the following factors may affect our operating results:\\n•\\nOur ability to continue to attract and retain users and customers to our products and services.\\n•\\nOur ability to attract user and/or customer adoption of, and generate significant revenues from, new\\nproducts, services, and technologies in which we have invested considerable time and resources.\\n•\\nOur ability to monetize traffic on Google properties and our Google Network Members\\' properties across\\nvarious devices.\\n•\\nRevenue fluctuations caused by changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy\\nchanges, product mix, and property mix.\\n•\\nThe amount of revenues and expenses generated and incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and\\nour ability to manage the resulting risk through our foreign exchange risk management program.\\n•\\nThe amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the\\nmaintenance and expansion of our businesses, operations, and infrastructure.\\n•\\nOur focus on long-term goals over short-term results.\\n•\\nThe results of our acquisitions, divestitures, and our investments in risky projects, including new\\nbusinesses, products, services, and technologies.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0c•\\nOur ability to keep our products and services operational at a reasonable cost and without service\\ninterruptions.\\n•\\nThe seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising spending, and underlying business trends such as\\ntraditional retail seasonality. Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our\\nbusiness. As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more\\npronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.\\n•\\nGeopolitical events, including trade disputes.\\n•\\nChanges in global business or macroeconomic conditions.\\nBecause our businesses are changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in\\npredicting our future operating results.\\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties,\\ndilution, and other consequences that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate\\nstrategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results.\\nWe expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic\\ntransactions, which could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we\\nface risks include:\\n•\\nDiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions\\nand other strategic transactions.\\n•\\nFailure to successfully integrate and further develop the acquired business or technology.\\n•\\nImplementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company.\\n•\\nIntegration of the acquired company’s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and\\ncoordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions.\\n•\\nTransition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms.\\n•\\nFailure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions\\nplaced upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or\\notherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction.\\n•\\nIn the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages\\nand to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific\\ncountries.\\n•\\nCultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization,\\nand retention of employees from the businesses we acquire.\\n•\\nLiability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark\\ninfringement claims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities,\\nand other known and unknown liabilities.\\n•\\nLitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated\\nemployees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future\\nacquisitions and other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur\\nunanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.\\nOur acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities,\\nthe incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased\\nlong-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition or operating results.\\nAlso, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not materialize. In\\nconnection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain\\npotential liabilities, which may harm our financial condition or operating results.\\nIf we were to lose the services of key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\\nOur future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior\\nmanagement team. For instance, Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0csubsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology. He also plays a key role in\\nmaintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will\\nemployees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key personnel could\\nseriously harm our business.\\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire\\nqualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.\\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success\\ndepends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas\\nof our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors\\nhave directly targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award\\nprograms, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing\\nemployees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to\\nretain and motivate our existing employees.\\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our\\norganization grows and evolves, we may need to implement more complex organizational management structures\\nor adapt our corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing circumstances, such as during times of a\\nnatural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19), and these changes could impact our ability to compete\\neffectively or have an adverse impact on our corporate culture.\\nIn preparing our financial statements, we incorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective in\\nnature and valuations may fluctuate over time.\\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt investments, certain other instruments including\\nstock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities\\nacquired in a business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The determination of fair value involves\\nuse of appropriate valuation methods and certain unobservable inputs, require management judgment and\\nestimation, and may change over time.\\nAs it relates to our non-marketable investments, the market values can be negatively affected by liquidity,\\ncredit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying companies, foreign exchange\\nrates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates\\nthat replace LIBOR, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors. The\\neffect of COVID-19 on our impairment assessment for non-marketable investments requires significant judgment\\ndue to the uncertainty around the duration and severity of the impact.\\nWe adjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments to fair value for observable transactions\\nof identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairments. All gains and losses on non-marketable\\nequity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), which increases the volatility\\nof our other income (expense).\\nAs a result of these factors, the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents, as well as our marketable and non-\\nmarketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect our\\nfinancial condition and operating results.\\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or\\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\\nOur future income taxes could be negatively affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions \\nthat have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, \\nthe net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other \\ntransactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax \\nassets or liabilities, the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws, regulations, or \\naccounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws), as well as certain discrete items.\\nIn addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result,\\nwe have received, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including in Europe, on\\nvarious tax-related assertions, such as transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any\\nadverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial\\ncondition and could require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. It may also\\nsubject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, resulting in the diversion of management’s time and\\nattention. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0csignificant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is\\nuncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts\\nrecorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which\\nsuch determination is made.\\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various\\njurisdictions may be subject to significant changes in ways that impair our financial results. In particular, France, the\\nUnited Kingdom, Italy, and other countries have enacted or are considering digital services taxes, which could lead\\nto inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation\\nand Development recently released a proposal relating to its initiative for modernizing international tax rules, with\\nthe goal of having different countries implement a modernized and aligned international tax framework, but there\\ncan be no guarantee that this will occur.\\nIn addition, in response to significant market volatility and disruptions to business operations resulting from the\\nglobal spread of COVID-19, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may\\npropose changes to their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect, and more\\npermanent changes. The impact of these potential new rules on us, our long-term tax planning, and our tax effective\\ntax rate could be material.\\nThe trading price for our Class A common stock and non-voting Class C capital stock may continue to\\nbe volatile.\\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be\\nvolatile. For example, from January 1, 2020 through March 31, 2020, the closing price of our Class A common stock\\nranged from $1,054.13 per share to $1,524.87 per share, and the closing price of our Class C capital stock ranged\\nfrom $1,056.62 per share to $1,526.69 per share.\\nIn addition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading price of our Class A common stock and Class C\\ncapital stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including,\\namong others:\\n•\\nQuarterly variations in our operating results or those of our competitors.\\n•\\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, new products,\\nsignificant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments.\\n•\\nRecommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates.\\n•\\nAnnouncements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations, the risk of which is\\nenhanced because it is our policy not to give guidance on earnings.\\n•\\nAnnouncements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations.\\n•\\nCommentary by industry and market professionals about our products, strategies, and other matters\\naffecting our business and results, regardless of its accuracy.\\n•\\nThe volume of shares of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock available for public sale.\\n•\\nSales of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock by us or by our stockholders (including sales by\\nour directors, executive officers, and other employees).\\n•\\nShort sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on shares of our Class A common stock and Class C\\ncapital stock.\\n•\\nThe perceived values of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock relative to one another.\\n•\\nAny share repurchase program.\\nIn addition, the stock market in general, which can be affected by various factors, including overall economic\\nand political conditions, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and\\nvolume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those\\ncompanies.\\nThese broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock and our\\nClass C capital stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\\nITEM 2.\\nUNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cThe following table presents information with respect to Alphabet\\'s repurchases of Class C capital stock during\\nthe quarter ended March 31, 2020.\\nPeriod\\nTotal Number of \\nShares Purchased \\n(in thousands) \\nAverage Price Paid per \\nShare\\nTotal Number of Shares \\nPurchased as Part of \\nPublicly Announced \\nPrograms\\n(in thousands) \\nApproximate Dollar \\nValue of Shares that \\nMay Yet Be Purchased \\nUnder the Program \\n(in millions) \\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\n$\\nTotal\\nIn July 2019, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $25.0 billion of its Class C\\ncapital stock. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions\\nand other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through\\nRule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. See Note 11 in Part I, Item 1 of this\\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to share repurchases.\\nAverage price paid per share includes costs associated with the repurchases.\\nITEM 5.\\nOTHER INFORMATION\\nOn April 22, 2020, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of Alphabet\\'s Board of\\nDirectors approved an equity award of $46.0 million to Ruth Porat, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial\\nOfficer, Alphabet and Google, in the form of restricted stock units (GSUs). In accordance with Alphabet’s equity\\ngrant practice and methodology, the grant will be made on the first Wednesday of May, and the number of GSUs\\ncomprising the grant will be calculated by dividing the equity award amount by the average closing price of\\nAlphabet’s Class C capital stock during the month of April 2020. The award will vest 2/16th on June 25th, 2020, and\\n1/16th quarterly thereafter until fully vested in December 2023, subject to continued employment. Upon vesting,\\neach GSU will entitle Ms. Porat to receive one share of Alphabet’s Class C capital stock.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\x0cITEM 6.\\nEXHIBITS\\nExhibit\\nNumber\\n  \\nDescription\\nIncorporated by reference herein\\nForm\\nDate\\n*\\nCertification of Chief Executive Officer pursuant to \\nExchange Act Rules 13a-14(a) and 15d-14(a), as \\nadopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-\\nOxley Act of 2002\\n*\\nCertification of Chief Financial Officer pursuant to \\nExchange Act Rules 13a-14(a) and 15d-14(a), as \\nadoptCertification of Chief Financial Officer pursuant \\nto Exchange Act Rules 13a-14(a) and 15d-14(a), as \\nadopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-\\nOxley Act of 2002\\n‡ Certifications of Chief Executive Officer and Chief \\nFinancial Officer pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
